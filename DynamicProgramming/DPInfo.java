     *
     *    1. Create a DP array or structure.
     *    2. Put a check condition just after base condition that is ans for curr call exists in DP or not.
     *    3. If ans doesn't exists then calculate it and store it in DP.
     *
     *    For Bottom Up DP (Tabulation method): (Bottom Up is solved using iterative method)
     *    0 ---> n (going from bottom to up)
     *
     *    1. Create a DP array.
     *    2. Observe the base condition of the solution and store the ans of the base condition value in the array initially and also check if input is base condition value/values or not.
     *    3. Iterate a loop with the recursive relation.
